# MountainWeatherCollector
This repository contains a personal project of application which would provide  functionality for weather data collection. The main goal is to build a platform  which would collect weather data from different mountain weather stations.  The long-term goal is to be able to provide that information and statistics to different weather forecast organisations hoping to improve their synoptic models regarding mountain weather.
